Faster response times correlate with higher customer satisfaction, highlighting the importance of timely issue resolution.



**💡 Recommendations**

**1. Optimize Response Times ⏳➡️⚡**

Focus on reducing handling and response times for high-impact issue categories.

**2. Agent Training 🎓📚**

Provide targeted training for agents handling complex issues like returns and cancellations.

**3. Proactive Issue Resolution 🔮🛠️**

Use predictive analytics to identify and address potential issues before they escalate.
